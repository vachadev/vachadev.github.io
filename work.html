                                    This year witnessed a series of sessions, workshops, campaigns, and exposure visits on life skills and gender. Sessions and workshops on goal setting, critical thinking, and the Right to Information workshop among others were undertaken for the older girls and pubertal changes, hormonal changes, as well as concepts and social relevance of menstruation, self-expression techniques among others, were undertaken with the younger girls.<br/><br/>Vacha acknowledges that exposure visits are essential for the overall growth of our program participants as these visits provide exposure to the world outside their communities. This year, our program participants visited the Nehru Science Centre, a post office, Public parks and gardens, a Bank, the Zoo, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee, a Police Station, a Health post, and the Solid Waste Management unit which was beneficial in helping the program participants understand the different systems. These visits often provide an opportunity for the program participants to display their skills such as leadership, critical thinking, and creativity.

                                    Participants in the age group of 13—17 years who have been regular and most active have been elected by others to become members of the Youth Council across 13 centers. Last year, the councils had joint meetings to discuss the challenges faced by the community and devised mitigation strategies.

                                    Mentorship of younger program participants by older girls is critical to generate cross-learning and experience sharing to work in the community. These older girls have been a part of the Vacha program for a long time and have a deep understanding of Vacha's work and thereby pose as an ideal mentor to the younger program participants. One of our objectives is to encourage community youth to own the project, hence we create opportunities for them to utilize skills imparted during their capacity-building sessions. This encourages the younger program participants to undertake community action with the support of the youth mentors.

The training highlighted issues of Sex and Gender, Patriarchy, Menstruation, and what it means to be an Adolescent Girl. A Power Walk was organized to illuminate how patriarchy, economic, social, cultural, and political structures create inequalities. The participants appreciated the examples of how structures like Family, Marriage, Religious practices, Economy perpetuate patriarchy and how women are impacted in the process.<br/><br/>In partnership with Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES), we undertook three pieces of training with non-profit organization teams, college students, and students pursuing bachelor’s degrees in education/ teacher training to build their capacities on advanced gender concepts. The training with non-profit organization teams was planned to create awareness on gender, patriarchy, and sexuality and its linkages in their fieldwork and personal lives. The training received an overwhelming response from the participants who narrated their life experiences from the gender purview. We conducted similar training for college students and students pursuing bachelors’ degrees in education/ teacher along with fairs. This event served as an excellent opportunity for college students to take complete ownership of handling the stalls and managing the crowd.</p>

There is no library facility in that area. We decorated the centre and mobilized about the library in the nearby communities and schools which led to the influx of students from the nearby schools who never had an opportunity to read a book. The library stocked books in 3 different languages - Hindi, English, and Marathi.<br/><br/>Books of different genres- storybooks, poetry, science and technology, quiz books, general knowledge, activity books, games, dictionaries, etc. along with 8-9 children’s magazines and 1 children’s newspaper were included in the library. The sessions included reading newspapers in English and two local languages, i.e. Hindi and Marathi. Initially, the facilitator and the youth volunteers read out stories and poems to them. This helped in generating interest among the adolescents since it was the very first time, they read newspapers and played interactive educational games. Many children shared that they loved reading poems, especially, in Hindi. Vacha youth groups played a critical role in driving this program in the center and nearby schools.</p>
