This empowerment process helps them to become active and productive citizens of society. We focus on equipping girls with skills such as photography, art and craft, poster and pamphlet making, street theatre for social awareness, newsletter creation and public speaking which aids them in their community work. We impart trainings and provide opportunities to help our programme participants to express themselves through different mediums effectively.<br/><br/> Exposure visits are organised to promote the overall growth of our programme participants as these visits help them understand different systems and provide exposure to the world outside their communities. Additionally, Vacha carries out trainings and workshops with adolescents to impart knowledge on health creating a postive attitude towards their body. Vacha helps them to overcome their health issues by creating awareness of opportunites and systems which they can access.</p>

This scholarship is awarded based on their active participation in the community as youth leaders and negotiating their rights to pursue higher studies along with their academic performance.

These ensure that they gain a platform to voice out their opinions. Youth are encouraged to attend conferences, trainings, seminars and workshops organised by like-minded organisations to build networking and communication skills.<br/><br/> Vacha is a coordinating agency of the Learning Community Project by Emerging Markets Foundation, which is a network of adolescent girls across seven Mumbai-based organisations. Its objective is to make essential interventions with girls to become pro-active and participate in public life and to develop leadership skills. For the fifth year in a row, these adolescent girls have led interventions, rallies, worked with the government structures and community-driven actions to bring a new paradigm of equality, dignity and freedom for girls in 10 wards of Mumbai.<br/><br/><b>In the year 2019 - 2020, girls worked on issues related to safety, access to clean toilets and zero dropouts in their communities.</b> Girls from one community applied for the Right to Information Act to know about the number of street lights, drafted letters, visited the company’s office and explained their issues. Their intervention led to the street lights being made functional. In another instance, a pressure group of women was formed by the youth group in one of our Kalyan communities to work on the issue of sanitation to raise concerns with the local authorities on the insufficient public toilet structures in proportion to the population. This has led to a reduction and re-enrollments of dropouts in the community which was witnessed in a survey study conducted by youth in 2019.</p>

In 2019, we aimed at formalising the existing mobile library programmeme and set up a permanent library in a poor community for underprivileged children and youth. There was no library facility in that area. Vacha Youth mobilised the library in the nearby communities and schools which led to an influx of students from the nearby schools who never had an opportunity to read a book. The objective of the programme was to inculcate reading habits and enhance knowledge among our programme participants.<br/><br/> Books of different genres- storybooks, poetry, science and technology, quiz books, general knowledge, activity books, games, dictionaries, etc. along with children’s magazines and newspapers are a part of the library. Our newspaper reading sessions generated considerable interest in adolescents as this was the first time they had read newspapers and played interactive educational games. Many children shared that they loved reading poems, especially, in Hindi. Vacha youth groups played a critical role in driving this programme in the centre and nearby schools.</p>
