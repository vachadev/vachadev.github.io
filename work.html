Older girls were trained in goal setting, critical thinking and the Right to Information while the younger girls were educated on pubertal changes, the social relevance of menstruation and self-expression techniques among others.<br/><br/> Exposure visits are essential for the overall growth of our program participants as these visits provide exposure to the world outside their communities. This year, our program participants visited the Nehru Science Centre, a post office, Public parks and gardens, a Bank, the Zoo, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee, a Police Station, a Health post and a Solid Waste Management unit which was beneficial in helping the program participants understand different systems.</p>

These older girls have a deep understanding of Vacha's work and therefore ideal mentors for the younger program participants. Mentorship also encourages community youth to own projects and utilize skills imparted during our capacity-building sessions. Younger program participants feel empowered to undertake community action with the support of their mentors.</p>

                                <p class="p3 p2xs blurb padtb25">This year, Vacha conducted a two-day training for nine team members of the Just for Kicks Organisation. The training highlighted issues of Sex and Gender, Patriarchy, Menstruation and what it means to be an Adolescent Girl. A Power Walk was organized to illuminate how patriarchy, economic, social, cultural and political structures create inequalities. The participants appreciated the examples of how structures like Family, Marriage, Religious practices, Economy perpetuate patriarchy and how women are impacted in the process. In partnership with Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES), we undertook three pieces of training with non-profit organization teams, college students and students pursuing bachelor’s degrees in education/ teacher training to build their capacities on advanced gender concepts. The training received an overwhelming response from the participants who narrated their life experiences from the gender purview. We conducted similar training for college students and students pursuing bachelors’ degrees in education/ teacher along with fairs.</p>
                                <p class="p3 p1xs fw7 pad30 bg-lightblue blue nomar poppins">In total, 138 women and 95 men underwent this training across organisations and through the gender-fair, participants were able to reach out to 671 women and 455 men.</p>

This year, we aimed to formalize the existing mobile library programme and set up a permanent library in a poor community in the recently urbanized village of Golavali near Kalyan for underprivileged children and youth. There is no library facility in that area. We decorated the centre and mobilized about the library in the nearby communities and schools which led to the influx of students from the nearby schools who never had an opportunity to read a book.<br/><br/> Books of different genres- storybooks, poetry, science and technology, quiz books, general knowledge, activity books, games, dictionaries, etc. along with children’s magazines and newspapers were included in the library. Our newspaper reading sessions generated considerable interest in adolescents as this was the first time they had read newspapers and played interactive educational games. Many children shared that they loved reading poems, especially, in Hindi. Vacha youth groups played a critical role in driving this program in the center and nearby schools.</p>
                                <p class="p3 p1xs fw7 pad30 bg-lightblue blue nomar poppins">Over 7000 books were distributed amongst adolescents from 21 neighborhood schools.</p>
