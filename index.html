Initiated by women active in the women’s rights movement, it started as a resource centre to address the need for space for discourse, resources and collective action. It was established and registered as a Trust in 1990.<br/><br/> Since 1995, Vacha has focused on working with adolescent girls and boys with a special focus on girls. Vacha looks at its work with adolescents as a preventive measure against the creation of vulnerabilities in women due to lack of education, exposure and opportunities. Vacha believes that empowered girls and sensitised boys have a better chance of developing into adults who value equality and become productive citizens.</p>

We create safe spaces in bastis (commonly referred to as slums) by hiring or sharing community spaces such as Aanganwadis, Community Halls etc. thereby fostering community partnerships and support. The houses in these bastis, are small and occupy around 5 to 7 family members in a space of less than 100 sq. ft. In these bastis, most families are Scheduled Castes (formerly considered untouchable) or are OBC (belonging to other backs ward castes) coming from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and rural Maharashtra. Girls in these communities are enrolled in poorly run state-supported schools or in low-paid private schools and educating or equipping them for life is not a priority with the residents in this community. Hence, Vacha began its work in these communities to equip girls with soft and hard skills to train them in taking up leadership roles in community work.</p>

The webinar emphasised prevention is better than cure.</p>

The youth are working on follow-up strategies to ensure that a maximum number of people get vaccinated. They will make and distribute pamphlets to motivate people to get vaccinated. Sessions on COVID 19, explaining the importance of taking timely action, precautions to follow and the facilities available for them are also being held and more are being planned.

                                    <p class="p4 nomar text-center">Reena, aged 18, is currently pursuing her Bachelor's degree in Accountancy and Finance and is in her 2nd year. She is one of the brightest students in the community, scoring the highest marks in her class. She has been with Vacha for the last 3 years and has been bright from the very beginning. But initially, she kept to herself, attending only classes and not participating in any of the activities organised by Vacha.<br/><br/>
                                    
                                    She was selected for the scholarship interview by a funding
                                    organization but she couldn’t clear the last round. This failure deeply affected Reena as this scholarship would have been a major support for her higher education, given her weak financial background. She approached Vacha to talk about her weaknesses and was counselled by Vacha coordinator on ways to sharpen her soft skills. Observing her will to improve, Vacha initially provided her with small responsibilities of managing the crowd in the Republic Day event of the community. She has been active in all the workshops organised so far and has successfully led the signature campaign on girls’ safety in her community.<br/><br/>
                                    
                                    She has been a part of all the dance performances, street plays and also volunteered for the dance presentation in the community during one of the community meetings. She confidently converses with funders during their visit and aptly describes the work of Vacha girls in her community. She is a role model among the younger programme participants who fondly address her as ‘didi’ and approach her for any query related to academic or community-related issues. Reena’s never-say-die spirit and optimistic attitude will help her attain her goals in life especially, in uplifting her family’s economic condition and working with the girls in creating a conducive environment for girls’ growth in the community.</p>

                                    <p class="p4 nomar text-center">14 year old Seema lives with her parents and two younger siblings in a remote area in Kalyan. Her father is a sales person and sells garments through door-to-door marketing and her mother supports the family income by packaging balloons at home in which all the three children assist her. Seema’s mother has poor vision and is also a diabetic patient because of which Seema undertakes all the household chores. Seema completes all her household chores before going to school and post returning she helps her mother in packaging the balloons and taking care of her younger siblings.<br/><br/>

                                    Seema's economic condition is very challenging and her family can barely meet their living expenses. In one of the remote areas in Kalyan, Vacha established a new resource centre in 2019 and she has been a part of the centre from the first day. She enjoys visiting the centre and participating in all the programmes and events organised by Vacha. At first, Seema was very shy and would not answer or participate in the discussions held in the centre.<br/><br/>
                                        
                                    Seema’s mother was very happy to learn about the things taught in the centre and assured Seema that she will adjust the household chores on days when the classes were planned. Seema’s happiness knew no bounds after gaining support and encouragement from her mother. It was observed that post her mother’s approval and encouragement, Seema started opening up during group discussions and putting forward her opinions freely. Now she attends Vacha classes regularly and when asked about what she likes about attending Vacha centre, she responded "Vacha is such a place where I feel liberated and happy. I want to study hard but due to the situation at home, I am not able to focus on my studies. But with Vacha’s support and motivation, I will surely reach my goal"..</p>
